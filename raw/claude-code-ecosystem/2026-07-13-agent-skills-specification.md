> The complete format specification for Agent Skills.

## Directory structure

A skill is a directory containing, at minimum, a `SKILL.md` file:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: metadata + instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
├── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
└── ...               # Any additional files or directories
```

## `SKILL.md` format

The `SKILL.md` file must contain YAML frontmatter followed by Markdown content.

### Frontmatter

| Field           | Required | Constraints                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`          | Yes      | Max 64 characters. Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. Must not start or end with a hyphen.             |
| `description`   | Yes      | Max 1024 characters. Non-empty. Describes what the skill does and when to use it.                                 |
| `license`       | No       | License name or reference to a bundled license file.                                                              |
| `compatibility` | No       | Max 500 characters. Indicates environment requirements (intended product, system packages, network access, etc.). |
| `metadata`      | No       | Arbitrary key-value mapping for additional metadata.                                                              |
| `allowed-tools` | No       | Space-separated string of pre-approved tools the skill may use. (Experimental)                                    |

Minimal example:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: A description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---
```

Example with optional fields:

```markdown
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract PDF text, fill forms, merge files. Use when handling PDFs.
license: Apache-2.0
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
---
```

#### `name` field

The required `name` field:

* Must be 1-64 characters
* May only contain unicode lowercase alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `0-9`) and hyphens (`-`)
* Must not start or end with a hyphen (`-`)
* Must not contain consecutive hyphens (`--`)
* Must match the parent directory name

Valid examples: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis`, `code-review`.
Invalid examples: `PDF-Processing` (uppercase not allowed), `-pdf` (cannot start with hyphen), `pdf--processing` (consecutive hyphens not allowed).

#### `description` field

The required `description` field:

* Must be 1-1024 characters
* Should describe both what the skill does and when to use it
* Should include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks

Good example: "Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges multiple PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents or when the user mentions PDFs, forms, or document extraction."

Poor example: "Helps with PDFs."

#### `license` field

The optional `license` field specifies the license applied to the skill. Recommended to keep short (either the name of a license or the name of a bundled license file), e.g. `license: Proprietary. LICENSE.txt has complete terms`.

#### `compatibility` field

The optional `compatibility` field:

* Must be 1-500 characters if provided
* Should only be included if the skill has specific environment requirements
* Can indicate intended product, required system packages, network access needs, etc.

Examples: `Designed for Claude Code (or similar products)`, `Requires git, docker, jq, and access to the internet`, `Requires Python 3.14+ and uv`.

Note: most skills do not need the `compatibility` field.

#### `metadata` field

The optional `metadata` field is a map from string keys to string values. Clients can use this to store additional properties not defined by the Agent Skills spec. Recommended to make key names reasonably unique to avoid accidental conflicts.

Example:

```yaml
metadata:
  author: example-org
  version: "1.0"
```

#### `allowed-tools` field

The optional `allowed-tools` field is a space-separated string of tools that are pre-approved to run. Experimental; support for this field may vary between agent implementations.

Example: `allowed-tools: Bash(git:*) Bash(jq:*) Read`

### Body content

The Markdown body after the frontmatter contains the skill instructions. There are no format restrictions.

Recommended sections:

* Step-by-step instructions
* Examples of inputs and outputs
* Common edge cases

Note that the agent will load this entire file once it's decided to activate a skill. Consider splitting longer `SKILL.md` content into referenced files.

## Optional directories

### `scripts/`

Contains executable code that agents can run. Scripts should:

* Be self-contained or clearly document dependencies
* Include helpful error messages
* Handle edge cases gracefully

Supported languages depend on the agent implementation. Common options include Python, Bash, and JavaScript.

### `references/`

Contains additional documentation that agents can read when needed:

* `REFERENCE.md` - Detailed technical reference
* `FORMS.md` - Form templates or structured data formats
* Domain-specific files (`finance.md`, `legal.md`, etc.)

Keep individual reference files focused. Agents load these on demand, so smaller files mean less use of context.

### `assets/`

Contains static resources:

* Templates (document templates, configuration templates)
* Images (diagrams, examples)
* Data files (lookup tables, schemas)

## Progressive disclosure

Agents load skills progressively, pulling in more detail only as a task calls for it. Skills should be structured to take advantage of this:

1. **Metadata** (~100 tokens): The `name` and `description` fields are loaded at startup for all skills
2. **Instructions** (< 5000 tokens recommended): The full `SKILL.md` body is loaded when the skill is activated
3. **Resources** (as needed): Files (e.g. those in `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/`) are loaded only when required

Keep the main `SKILL.md` under 500 lines. Move detailed reference material to separate files.

## File references

When referencing other files in a skill, use relative paths from the skill root:

```markdown
See [the reference guide](references/REFERENCE.md) for details.

Run the extraction script:
scripts/extract.py
```

Keep file references one level deep from `SKILL.md`. Avoid deeply nested reference chains.

## Validation

Use the skills-ref reference library (https://github.com/agentskills/agentskills/tree/main/skills-ref) to validate skills:

```bash
skills-ref validate ./my-skill
```

This checks that `SKILL.md` frontmatter is valid and follows all naming conventions.
